# LED-Toggling-Switch
This project demonstrates GPIO control on an STM32 microcontroller. It configures a button input (PA0) and two LEDs (PD13, PD15) as outputs. When the button is pressed, LED6 blinks; when released, LED3 blinks. It covers GPIO setup, clock enable, and basic input/output handling for embedded systems.
